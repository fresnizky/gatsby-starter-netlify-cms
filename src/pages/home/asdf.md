    Using YOUR CAR, WILL can... 


    Wait with your car instead of parking. Take you from appointment to
    appointment, to/from the airport, be your designated driver, shuttle you to
    work and back, replace taxis, etc… for 19/hr! 


    The customizable use cases are endless. For your project, WILL creates an
    amenity that extends beyond the building and throughout the city.
