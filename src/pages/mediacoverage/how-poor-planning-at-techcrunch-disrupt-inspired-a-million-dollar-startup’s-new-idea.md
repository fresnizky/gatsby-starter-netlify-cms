  How Poor Planning at TechCrunch Disrupt Inspired a Million-Dollar Startup’s
  New Idea
excerpt: >-
  If you ask anyone about TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2016, they might remember the
  speakers, but they will definitely remember the hassle it was to get there.
  This past May, the three-day conference was held at the Brooklyn Cruise
  Terminal in the industrial area of Red Hook, Brooklyn, which is located more
  than 30 minutes walking from the nearest subway station. Many attendees fought
  over surge-priced Ubers and Lyfts (which were a bit hard to come by at the
  conference’s close, since we were in such a remote area), but some, including
  myself, trekked to the train-a walk that, via the conference’s slightly
  misleading address at 72 Bowne Street, included crossing an interstate highway
  and walking through a shipping yard where I had to step over hoses and other
  boating equipment. I eventually found a route that allowed me to avoid the
  shipping obstacles, but it tacked on some extra time.
