NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DropCar (NASDAQ:DCAR), a provider of automotive vehicle support and logistics services for both consumers and the automotive industry, today celebrated its recent listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market by ringing the Nasdaq Stock Market Opening Bell. The company acquired its symbol upon the completion of its merger with WPCS International, which was completed on January 30, 2018.



“We are positioned to become the middleware for the new urban mobility,” said Spencer Richardson, co-founder and CEO of DropCar at the bell ringing ceremony. “Our cloud-based logistics platform, combined with our mobile app and hundreds of professionally-trained drivers enables us to ensure consumers have the vehicle they want at the place they want at the time they want it.



“We’re working toward a future where our app is not only on your phone, but in your car, on your Echo, Google Home and on your Apple HomePod. You will be able to say: ‘I want the SUV charged up and ready at 5:30 pm today at home.’ And boom – it will be there.”



DropCar’s cloud-based platform and mobile app blends the efficiency and scale of cloud computing, machine learning and connected cars with the high-touch of highly trained drivers to help both consumers and mobility-related companies overcome the costs and logistics headaches of vehicle ownership and access in congested cities.



DropCar provides consumers with best-in-class, on-demand vehicle pickup, parking, service, and delivery. DropCar’s logistics platform helps dealers, leasing companies, and shared mobility companies reduce costs, better serve customers and create new revenue streams.
