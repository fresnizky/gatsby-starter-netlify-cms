NEW YORK, Nov. 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DropCar, Inc. ("DropCar"), a software and logistics provider of cloud- and app-based vehicle support and concierge services for both the automotive industry and consumers, today announced the entry into a definitive agreement with Toyota of Manhattan to utilize DropCar’s Enterprise Vehicle Assistance & Logistics technology platform ("VAL"). DropCar’s VAL platform will enable Toyota of Manhattan"s maintenance and sales teams to provide an entirely new level of service to their customers by automating the pickup and delivery of vehicles for service and maintenance.

"Our platform enables dealerships to meet the expectations of today’s time-deprived urban professionals by automating the process of servicing or repairing a car so it happens in the background to their daily lives," said Spencer Richardson, co-founder and CEO of DropCar. "Not only is the experience more convenient for customers, but it also allows dealerships to drive new service revenue that would have otherwise never occurred or gone elsewhere."

This new agreement augments DropCar’s expanding enterprise base of premier automotive customers, which includes a wide range of dealerships operating throughout the Tri-state area (including Lexus of Manhattan, Jaguar and Land Rover of Manhattan, Mercedes Benz of Manhattan) and other Tier-One automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In October, DropCar announced a similar agreement with Manhattan Motorcars, Inc., a dealer of Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti vehicles.

DropCar’s VAL platform coordinates the movements and schedules of professional valets who transport vehicles to and from dealerships to customer locations, removing the need for a customer to drive their vehicle in for service. Dealerships access the VAL platform via any browser where they can schedule, track in real time and report on vehicle movements, repair status and customer feedback. This level of convenience enables dealers to retain valuable post-sale service contracts and revenue from their customers.

"Toyota owners know that the best service and repair comes only from the Toyota-certified technicians at Toyota of Manhattan, and our partnership with DropCar now makes it a snap for them to ensure their vehicle is in the best hands," said Michael Grau, General Manager of Toyota of Manhattan.

On September 6, 2017, DropCar and WPCS International Incorporated (NASDAQ:WPCS), entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby DropCar will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPCS with the DropCar securityholders receiving approximately 85% of the outstanding shares of WPCS common stock on a fully-diluted basis.
