NEW YORK, Oct. 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DropCar, Inc. ("DropCar"), a software and logistics provider of cloud- and app-based vehicle support and concierge services for both the automotive industry and consumers, today announced a new partnership with Manhattan Motorcars, Inc., a dealer of Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti vehicles. DropCar will provide its Vehicle Assistance & Logistics technology platform ("VAL") for Manhattan Motorcars’ maintenance and sales teams, allowing them to provide an entirely new level of service to their customers.

Manhattan Motorcars now joins Jaguar and Land Rover of Manhattan, Mercedes Benz of Manhattan and Lexus of Manhattan, as well as other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and dealerships operating throughout the tristate area that utilize DropCar to support their urban mobility.

DropCar’s VAL platform coordinates the movements and schedules of professional valets who transport vehicles to and from dealerships to customer locations, removing the need for a customer to drive their vehicle in for service. Dealerships access the VAL platform via any browser where they can schedule, track in real time and report on vehicle movements, repair status and customer feedback. This level of convenience enables dealers to retain valuable post-sale service contracts and revenue from their customers.

"Our platform enables dealerships to modernize their customer experience by removing the time and hassle associated with bringing a car in for scheduled maintenance or repairs as well as benefiting from greater transparency into their daily operations," said Spencer Richardson, co-founder and CEO of DropCar. "This model fits in well with the emerging trends of automobile ownership as a service, and we believe enables today’s dealerships to build longer-term relationships with their customers."

DropCar’s VAL platform helps dealerships address challenges stemming from several major societal shifts, such as:

Today’s urban professionals have limited time to bring in their vehicles for maintenance and service; Increasing real estate costs are forcing many of the vehicle support centers for automotive providers (i.e., dealerships, including body work and diagnostic shops) out of prime urban areas; and New entrants now offer to bring services, such as fueling, damage repair, oil changes, etc., directly to the car. Collectively, these trends are making it harder for dealers to maintain the service revenue they depend on and DropCar believes that it is well positioned to become the urban mobility partner of note in adapting to these trends.

"We sell and service some of the most exclusive brands in the world, and we set the highest standards for service and quality," said Marc Faraj, General Manager at Manhattan Motorcars. "We needed a logistics partner we could trust to deliver those same standards, and DropCar has shown an ability to do just that. Our clients appreciate the convenience, which enables us to make sure their vehicles perform at their peak at all times."
