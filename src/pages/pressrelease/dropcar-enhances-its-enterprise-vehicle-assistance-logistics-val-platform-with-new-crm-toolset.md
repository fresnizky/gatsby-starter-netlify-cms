NEW YORK, Dec. 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DropCar, a provider of automotive vehicle support and concierge services for both consumers and the automotive industry, today announced an upgrade to its Enterprise Vehicle Assistance and Logistics (VAL) platform, utilized by automobile dealerships to schedule valet pickup and drop-off of customer vehicles for service and maintenance appointments. The new toolset gives customers one-click access to the scheduling system, making it easier and more convenient for both dealerships and customers to facilitate these appointments.

The DropCar VAL platform is a web-based interface to DropCar’s core service that coordinates the movements and schedules of trained valets who pickup and drop off cars at dealerships and customer locations. The app tracks progress and provides email and text notifications on status to both dealers and customers, increasing the quality of communication and subsequent satisfaction with the service. 

"This upgrade to VAL for our enterprise clients fit perfectly with today’s mobile-first, on-demand, efficiency-minded urban resident," said Spencer Richardson, co-founder and CEO of DropCar. "It simplifies the entire maintenance lifecycle for the car owner and helps dealers develop and preserve valuable, long-term customer relationships."

DropCar’s VAL system dispatches professional valets to pick up the car from the customer and deliver it to the dealer, and back to the customer when the service is complete. This high-touch service enables dealers to retain valuable post-sale service contracts and revenue from their customers. Prior to this upgrade, service scheduling was done by a dealership service representative; now, with DropCar’s VAL platform, car owners can directly access the portal with a single click to schedule a car pickup. Via their mobile device, car owners can also monitor in real time on a live map the exact location and status of their vehicle during transport.

"DropCar’s vehicle support and valet service has provided a new way to deepen relationships with our customers by offering them a service that saves them time and hassle, while simultaneously protecting the investment they’ve made in their vehicle," said Al Louzoun, General Manager of Queensboro Toyota. "With DropCar, it’s a snap for them to schedule service, knowing that the car will be picked up, serviced and returned to them on the date, time and location of their choosing."

DropCar’s VAL platform helps dealerships address challenges stemming from the following major societal shifts:

\- Today’s urban professionals have limited time to bring in their vehicles for maintenance and service;

\- Increasing real estate costs are forcing many of the vehicle support centers for automotive providers (i.e., dealerships, including body work and diagnostic shops) farther outside of dense urban areas; and

\- New market entrants now offer to bring services, such as fueling, damage repair, oil changes, etc., directly to the vehicle owner.

Collectively, these trends are making it harder for dealers to maintain a relationship with the customer after he or she drives off the lot. DropCar believes it is well positioned to become a key partner in helping dealers leverage technology to reverse these trends.

On September 6, 2017, DropCar and WPCS International Incorporated (NASDAQ:WPCS), entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby DropCar will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPCS with the DropCar securityholders receiving approximately 84% of the outstanding shares of WPCS common stock on a fully-diluted basis.
