NEW YORK, Dec. 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DropCar, Inc. ("DropCar"), a provider of app-based automotive logistics and concierge services for both consumers and dealers, today announced the expansion of its B2B service by partnering with Lexus of Queens, owned by the BRAM Auto Group, one of the largest family-owned businesses in the Tri-State Area. 

The Dealer Service Agreement ("Agreement") provides dealers with access to DropCar's Enterprise Vehicle Assistance & Logistics technology platform ("VAL"). The platform's corresponding data analysis tools, plus DropCar's vehicle concierge service together enable the dealer's maintenance and sales teams to deliver an entirely new and improved level of service, by automating the pickup and delivery of customer vehicles for maintenance. These vehicle movements are handled by DropCar's growing corps of over 250 professional valet drivers. 

According to Mr. Salvatore Iacono, BRAM Auto Group's Vice President of Fixed Operations, "It's rare to find a service that, not only helps us improve customer satisfaction significantly, but also increases revenue and reduces operating costs; DropCar does all three. We've been impressed with the overall success we've seen with DropCar in Lexus of Manhattan, and we're looking to replicate it in Queens."

Lexus of Queens joins a growing constellation of regional dealers in the Tri-State area that have adopted DropCar's enterprise vehicle logistics and concierge service. Other dealerships that have partnered with DropCar include: Lexus of Manhattan, Jaguar and Land Rover of Manhattan, Mercedes Benz of Manhattan, Toyota of Manhattan and Manhattan Motorcars, Inc., a dealer of Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti vehicles.

For the trailing 90 days ending December 18, 2017, DropCar has moved 197% more vehicles for dealerships than it did during the same period last year, resulting in B2B revenue growth of 155% for the same comparable periods.

"In addition to building technology and an agile workforce designed to help modernize the over 300 million maintenance & repair jobs that dealerships service in the United States annually, we are also excited to be working with our partners to offer DropCar's full spectrum of B2C service offerings to their customer bases in the New York metropolitan area markets we currently serve," added Spencer Richardson, DropCar Chief Executive Officer.
