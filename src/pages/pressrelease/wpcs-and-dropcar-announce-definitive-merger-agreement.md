SUISUN, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 6, 2017) - WPCS International Incorporated (NASDAQ: WPCS), a low-voltage solutions provider and DropCar, Inc. ("DropCar"), a privately-held provider of app-based automotive logistics and concierge services for both consumers and the automotive industry, jointly announced that today the parties have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby WPCS will acquire DropCar in an all-stock transaction.

According to Sebastian Giordano, CEO of WPCS, "Our goal has been to provide an opportunity to enhance stockholder value, and we believe that DropCar is well-positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning auto-tech and next-generation mobility and logistics services industry." Key aspects include:

DropCar is a leading provider of a cloud and app based logistics and vehicle support platform that reduces the costs, hassles, and inefficiencies of owning or servicing a car or fleet in urban areas;

DropCar's multi-channel business model is positioned for expansion into new markets and continued partnerships with large OEMs, automotive branded dealerships, shared mobility providers, fleet owners and real estate developers; 

Current stockholders of WPCS are expected to own approximately 15% of the outstanding common stock of WPCS (after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding WPCS stock options) and the stockholders of, and certain advisors to, DropCar are expected to own approximately 85% of the outstanding common stock of WPCS (after giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding DropCar warrants). 

A highly qualified management team with substantial and demonstrated experience in technological innovation and automotive-related logistics will lead the combined company. DropCar's Co-Founder and CEO, Spencer Richardson will assume the role of CEO of the merged entity, while Mr. Giordano will remain as a member of the Board of Directors. In addition to Messrs. Richardson and Giordano, the Board will be comprised of a total of seven directors, including, DropCar's Co-Founder, David Newman, three DropCar designees, and Joshua Silverman who currently serves on WPCS's Board.

Mr. Richardson is a proven and successful technology innovator who previously built FanBridge into a premier Fan Audience CRM platform with over 600 million fan relationships. Mr. Newman will continue to lead DropCar's business-development, leveraging his 20 years of experience in the legal, real estate and parking garage sectors.

Mr. Richardson stated that, "Today, our platform takes away the hassle of owning a car in the city for consumers while simultaneously helping OEMs, dealers, and shared mobility providers reduce costs and deepen connections with customers. We believe this merger will enable us to further scale this platform and position us well to become the de-facto standard in a future where auto purchases give way to auto subscriptions."

Immediately following the completion of the merger, the current stockholders of WPCS are expected to own approximately 15% of the outstanding common stock of WPCS (after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding WPCS stock options) and the stockholders of DropCar, as well as certain advisors to DropCar, are expected to own the remaining approximately 85% of the outstanding common stock of WPCS (after giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding DropCar warrants). The actual allocation of equity will be subject to adjustment based on various factors, including WPCS' "net cash" balance at closing.

The transaction, which has been approved by the board of directors of both companies, is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions, including: approval by the stockholders of both WPCS and DropCar; a requirement by DropCar to raise at least $4 million prior to the consummation of the merger; and approval by NASDAQ for the listing of WPCS common stock immediately upon consummation of the merger. Upon closing of the transaction, the merged company will operate under the DropCar name, and the Company's common stock will trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under a ticker symbol to be announced at a later date.

Palladium Capital Advisors, LLC acted as the advisor to DropCar on this transaction and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. acted as legal counsel to DropCar. Morse, Zelnick, Rose & Lander, LLP acted as legal counsel to WPCS.
